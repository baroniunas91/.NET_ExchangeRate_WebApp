# Requirements
* You have to create a small web application which will display a list of changes for currency rates for the selected date. The user should be able to select a date, then click a button and get a list of changes for currency rate of each currency.
The change for currency rate is calculated by comparing currency rate on selected date and one day before.
* The currency exchange rates can be taken from a public web service: http://www.lb.lt/webservices/ExchangeRates/ExchangeRates.asmx?op=getExchangeRatesByDate
* *please note that it works just with the dates up to the end of the year 2014.
* Results have to be ordered- highest exchange rate increases first.
